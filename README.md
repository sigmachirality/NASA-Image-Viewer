My submission for Capital One's 2019 Software Summit challenge, which you can find [here](https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/nasa-image-archive).

The idea behind my website's design was to keep it as minimalistic as possible - I ended up taking design cues from Pinterest (such as the masonry image layout and the infinite scroll functionality). In line with this design philosophy, the site is fully deployable as a static website.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is live [on Heroku](https://nasa-image-viewer.herokuapp.com/)!

## Running and Building

In the project directory, first run:

### `npm install`

This installs the required packages, such as react-bootstrap and Axios. Afterwards, run

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
